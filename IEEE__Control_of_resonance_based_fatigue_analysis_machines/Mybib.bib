ABSTRACT = {In this study, the fatigue strength of polished drill pipe specimens was investigated and compared with previous test results of corroded and not-corroded pipes. The resonant fatigue test rig, which was designed and implemented by the University of Pisa, is initially presented by providing a detailed description of the set-up of the machine, the calibration of the strain gauges, the control system, and the correct identification of the vibrational node locations. A polishing rig was also designed and put into operation to remove the corrosion pits from the outer surface of almost the entire length of the drill pipe specimens. After the fatigue tests with the resonant rig, and the observation of the fatigue fracture of the specimens, a few samples were extracted from different zones (corroded and not corroded) of the failed drill pipe specimens. This allowed for investigations to be carried out using a scanning electronic microscope. The obtained results were analyzed using the Murakami model, and a discussion is presented about the effect of the corrosion pits on the fatigue strength.},

The idea is to accumulate fatigue energy on a base-excited plate specimen at high-frequency resonant modes and to complete a fatigue test in a much more efficient way at very low cost. The methodology consists of (1) a topological design procedure, incorporating a finite element model, to characterize the shape of the specimens for ensuring the required stress state/pattern, (2) a vibration feedback empirical procedure for achieving the high-cycle fatigue experiments with variable-amplitude loading, and finally (3) a yielding procedure for achieving various uniaxial stress ratios. The performance of the methodology is demonstrated by the experimental results from mild steel, 6061-T6 aluminum, and Ti-6Al-4V plate specimens subjected to fully reversed bending for both uniaxial and biaxial stress states. }",

@article{Azcona2019,
   abstract = {The design of floating wind turbines needs the validation of numerical models against measurements obtained from experiments that accurately represent the system dynamics. This requires solving the conflict in the scaling of the hydrodynamic and aerodynamic forces that arises in tests with wind and waves. To sort out this conflict, we propose a hybrid testing method that uses a ducted fan to replace the rotor and introduce a force representing the aerodynamic thrust. The force is obtained from a simulation of the rotor coupled in real time with the measured platform displacements at the basin. This method is applied on a test campaign of a semisubmersible wind turbine with a scale factor of 1/45. The experimental data are compared with numerical computations using linear and non-linear hydrodynamic models. Pitch decays in constant wind show a good agreement with computations, demonstrating that the hybrid testing method correctly introduces the aerodynamic damping. Test cases with constant wind and irregular waves show better agreement with the simulations in the power spectral density's (PSD's) low-frequency region when non-linear hydrodynamics are computed. In cases with turbulent wind at rated wind speed, the low-frequency platform motions are dominated by the wind, hiding the differences from hydrodynamic non-linearities. In these conditions, the agreement between experiments using the proposed hybrid method and computations is good in all the frequency range both for the linear and the non-linear hydrodynamic models. Conversely, for turbulent winds producing lower rotor thrust, non-linear hydrodynamics are relevant for the simulation of the low-frequency system dynamics.},

   abstract = {Wave tank testing is a crucial step during the development of floating offshore wind concepts. Scaled prototypes are engineered to represent the most important phenomena related to the fluid-structure interaction. Nevertheless, in the case of floating wind turbines, the interaction between turbine aerodynamics and platform hydrodynamics presents important challenges that need to be considered. A new hybrid system focused on floating wind turbine tank testing is presented in this paper. It is based on a variety of fans, a multi-fan, which allows the high-fidelity reproduction of a wide range of wind turbine aerodynamics. One of the main advantages of the new methodology proposed, is the possibility to include other loading aside from thrust and wind turbine torque. The most important aerodynamic loads are represented. In fact, it has been demonstrated that wind turbine thrust can be captured with less than 0.5% error compared to the theoretical value. It is also possible to simultaneously model the thrust, torque and shear moments on the rotor within an error below 2%. The multi-fan system deploys a fast rate of change, up to 35N/s, guaranteeing the scaled dynamics. In unsteady wind speeds using 4% of atmospheric turbulence, 94% of the total energy is captured.},

   abstract = {Floating offshore wind turbines provide more access to deeper water than conventional fixed-bottom wind turbines, which expands the viable area for wind energy development, reduces visibility from shore, and can potentially be located in areas with a higher and steadier wind characteristic. However, since floating turbines are in the early prototype stage of development, there are very limited data to use for validating computer models of these machines. This lack of validation increases uncertainty and risk for future installations. In lieu of large scale test turbines, which are expensive to build and operate, a few institutions have conducted small scale experiments in wave basins. This paper will present a review of the past and planned model-scale floating offshore wind turbine experiments, with a focus on types of data collected and challenges encountered by these tests. The objective of this review is to provide a background for the Integrated Research Program on Wind Energy (IRPWind), specifically for Work Packages 6.1 and 6.2. The goal of these work packages is to create a database of both fixed-bottom and floating offshore wind turbine test cases that can be accessed by researchers to verify and validate computer-aided engineering codes. The database will consist of a number of benchmarks that will validate different parts of a given design code. This review will discuss two model experiments that are likely to be included in the IRPWind database.},

   abstract = {Modelling floating offshore wind turbines (FOWTs) is challenging due to the strong coupling between the aerodynamics of the turbine and the hydrodynamics of the floating platform. Physical testing at scale is faced with the additional challenge of the scaling mismatch between Froude number and Reynolds number due to working in the two fluid domains, air and water. In the drive for cost-reduction of floating wind energy, designers may be seeking to move towards high-fidelity numerical modelling as a substitute for physical testing. However, the numerical engineering tools typically used for FOWT modelling are considered as mid-fidelity to low-fidelity tools, and currently lack the level of accuracy required to do so. Furthermore, there is a lack of operational FOWT data available for further development and validation. High-fidelity tools, such as CFD, have greater accuracy but are cumbersome tools and still require validation. Physical scale model testing therefore continues to play an essential role in the development of FOWTs both as a source of validation data for numerical models and as an important development step along the path to commercialization of all platform concepts. The aim of this paper is to provide an overview of both numerical modelling and physical FOWT scale model testing approaches and to provide guidance on the selection of the most appropriate approach (or combination of approaches). The current state-of-the-art will be discussed along with current research trends and areas for further investigation.},

   abstract = {This paper describes an experimental and numerical investigation of the Iberdrola TLP wind turbine concept, TLPWIND, in realistic wind and wave conditions. The TLP was coupled to the NREL 5 MW reference turbine and was designed to operate in a water depth of 70 m. The test campaign included free oscillation tests, tests in regular and irregular waves and simulated wind conditions. A Software-in-the-loop approach was adopted to account for the time-varying aerodynamic forces produced by the turbine during the physical experiments. The effect of wind was found to have a significant contribution to the overall response of the platform whilst variation in wave conditions was found to have a relatively small effect on the platform response. A comparison of results from physical and numerical simulations show that, the numerical predictions from FAST were very close to the results obtained from the experiments in some cases, but in other cases the numerical model failed to accurately predict the platform response. The results from both studies show the benefits of such TLP structures in terms of motions which are vital to obtain a high power output from a floating offshore wind turbine.},

   abstract = {The relevance of the interaction between the structural stiffness and the wind turbine dynamics are well known by the industry from decades of expertise. However, the novel floating concepts are commonly designed by tools that disregard the individual structural stiffness of the elements which compose the floating platform. Usually, these elements are treated as rigid body elements in the design process. However, their flexibility can be relevant in the long time structural life assessment, particularly for the fatigue assessment. Then, a structural analysis that includes the dynamic effects over the deformation of the structure is required. The paper proposes a model that integrates the instantaneous deformation of the structure by a nonlinear dynamic Finite Element Analysis (FEA) computation in a fully coupled Offshore Wind Turbine (WT) model in the time domain. A 3D hydro-aero-servo-elastic coupled numerical model in time domain for structural analysis of floating or bottom fixed structures has been developed at the UPC-BarcelonaTech. The code integrates the forces exerted by the waves and currents as well as the aerodynamic loads, including the wind turbine, and the mooring system. For the hydrodynamic loads the Morison's equation is used to compute waves and current forces. Both Airy (regular and irregular) and Stokes 5th order wave theories are implemented. The mooring system can be computed in a quasi-static way or considering their fully dynamics. The aerodynamic loads are computed with AeroDyn standalone module from NREL, which is coupled to the FE model. The structure is discretized with one-dimensional beam finite elements, in which the formulation considers small strains as well as large motions under the implementations of the Euler beams theory. With this approach, the dynamic interaction between the wind turbine and the structure, as well as the effects on the internal forces are implicitly coupled in the formulation. A comparison of the Windcrete concrete SPAR concept experimental Response Amplitude Operators (RAO) against the numerical results are presented, as well as some results from simulations under normal operation conditions.},

   abstract = {There are different approaches utilized to establish dynamic models for floating offshore wind turbines, but their distinction and applicability are often confusing. This paper presents the theories about four different dynamic models developed for simulating floating wind turbines, including a single-rigid-body model, a corrected single-rigid-body model, a multi-rigid-body model, and a multi-rigid-flexible-body model. Subsequently, a series of comparisons between the four dynamic models are conducted to assess their differences and applicability for simulating floating offshore wind turbines. The results show that the multi-rigid-flexible-body model is most accurate but most time-consuming. In most cases, the multi-rigid-body model and the multi-rigid-flexible-body model can be performed, except for the aeroelastic effects and global dynamic responses caused by the vibration of the tower and blades. In contrast, the single-rigid-body model has simpler dynamical methodologies and less computational cost. However, it has some internal limitations, for instance, limited degrees of freedom, neglecting aeroelastic effects, neglecting gyroscopic effects, etc. Hence, the corrected single-rigid-body model is proposed and performs better than the original single-rigid-body model at the cost of a little time-consumption.},

In addition, a methodology and a metric are presented for the assessment of the uncertainty across the full time series for the response of a floating wind energy platform during wave basin testing. It is shown that there is a significant cost incurred in terms of experimental uncertainty through the addition of rotor thrust in the laboratory environment for the considered platform. A slight reduction in experimental uncertainty is observed through the introduction of gyroscopic rotor loading for most platform responses.},

   abstract = {Copyright © 2018 John Wiley  &  Sons, Ltd. Hybrid modeling combining physical tests and numerical simulations in real time opens new opportunities in floating wind turbine research. Wave basin testing is an important validation step for floating support structure design, but current methods are limited by scaling problems in the aerodynamic loadings. Applying wind turbine loads with an actuation system controlled by a simulation that responds to the basin test offers a way to avoid scaling problems and reduce cost barriers for floating wind turbine design validation in realistic coupled conditions. In this work, a cable-based hybrid coupling approach is developed and implemented for 1:50-scale wave basin tests with the DeepCwind semisubmersible floating wind turbine. Tests are run with thrust loads provided by a numerical wind turbine model. Matching tests are run with physical wind loads using an above-basin wind maker. When the numerical submodel is set to match the aerodynamic performance of the physical scaled wind turbine, the results show good agreement with purely physical wind-wave tests, validating the hybrid model approach. Further hybrid model tests with simulated true-to-scale dynamic thrust loads and wind turbulence show noticeable differences and demonstrate the value of a hybrid model approach for improving the true-to-scale realism of floating wind turbine basin tests.},
